# Web application for managing a library

I needed to build a simple web app for managing a library with books
and authors.

The app was divided into two parts. Frontend part was written using React
library, Redux state management system, react-router-dom and pure CSS. Server part was developed with NodeJS + ExpressJS.
Uploading images to the server was implemented using multer library.

To start using application you should follow these steps:

1. cd frontend
2. npm install
3. npm run dev
3. cd backend
4. npm install
5. npm start
6. follow this link in browser http://localhost:5173

Application has simple user-friendly interface.
